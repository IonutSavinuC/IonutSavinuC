ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Ionut Savin and this is my GitHub portfolio.

I have completed a QA Manual & Automation Testing course, where I gained hands-on experience with test case creation, bug reporting in Jira, API testing with Postman, and automation testing using CypressJS. Additionally, I explored basic performance testing with JMeter and version control with GitHub and SourceTree.

I'm always willing to learn, searching for new things so that I can develop myself. I consider myself optimistic, curious, and I have a strong desire to learn new things
